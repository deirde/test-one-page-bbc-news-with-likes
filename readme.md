# TEST - ONE PAGE BBC NEWS WITH LIKES #

Specs
-----

Weâ€™d like you to create a one-page web site that allows users to view a list of stories from the BBC news site, and to vote on their favourite stories.<br/>
You can use the RSS feed for the BBC site from this URL:<br/>
http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_uk_edition/front_page/rss.xml<br/>
<br/>
The story list should sit on the home page. Give your home page a title and an introductory paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
The list component should consume the RSS feed, display the stories and allow the site user to select which stories they like. Give the user a Vote button to register their votes.<br/>
<br/>
Create a webservice in your site which will be called when the user clicks the Vote button. The webservice should accept a list of votes and update the total votes for each story selected. Store this data as an XML file on your site.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than a vote button to submit all the selected stories you may wish to consider an AJAX solution to capture each story as it is selected/ deselected.<br/>
Comment the code where you might make improvements given more time and assuming it was going to be actually used in a live environment.
